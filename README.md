  ## Contributing
  Feel free to contribute. One area that could use attention is the wheels.

  ## Tests
  Make sure all vehicle types can created successfully. Test that only the truck can tow, it can't tow itself, and it can't tow vehicles above its towing capacity. Make sure that only the motorbike can do wheelies.
